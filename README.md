This project was developed for the  Liminal Gamejam hosted by  MCL Software: 

In this game we play as a man trying to deliver his IRS, however as we all know  Government Finance  Buildings tend to be as liminal as they come. 
Scouring the premises for the right room  while fighting the burocratic fight of delivering papers and talking to the always NPC-like Social servants, all while remainning sane and fighting the urge of just going home. 
This is our quest,  to make it as annoying and disorienting as possible.

this project was inspired by "Estado Novo" architecture,  a style from the 50s-70s that is very present in the governmental buildings of Portugal.

the game is posted and playable in https://itch.io/jam/liminal2/rate/2874463 ;
